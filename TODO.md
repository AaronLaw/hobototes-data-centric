# Notes


### On design the calculation of the 2nd leg fee.

@see ./hobototes-data-centric design.md

2014-09-13:

in 10g increment.

2nd leg fee should be made of 2 parts: the exact product weight, and the weight of packing.

2014-09-30:

After a deep thinking:
The calculation of 2nd leg fee in the Product Topic should not be precise. For example: An apple cutter we'got is made of plastic. One day later, I've found an apple cutter of the same shape made of steel. So, how to determent the weight of THAT apple cutter in THAT TOPIC? (plastic vs steel)

Therefore, I intend to put the calculation in SKU model also.

### Upgrade to Django 1.7

2014-09-16:

	pip install Django==1.7

### Separt category as an individual model

2014-09-02:

objective: 

我要把 `competitor_sources` 的 `category`copy 到 `producte_category` 去，並且最好按出現的 freq 從大到小排序（方便將來按 `id` 順序選擇時，最常用的 category name 會最先出現。）（現時是以 `name` 的順序去排序，A 在最先而 Z 在最後。）

把 `competitor_sources` 的 `category`copy 到 `producte_category` 去：

	insert into `product_category`(name)  SELECT DISTINCT `category` from `competitor_sources`
Google: insert into
http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert_into_select.asp

如何抽取到 distinct 的 category name 呢？

	SELECT  `category`, count(category) from `competitor_sources`  group by category


所以要按 freq 從大到小排序的話，就是：

	SELECT `category`, count(category) from `competitor_sources`  group by category  order by count(category) desc


按 freq 從高到低放到去 id 的做法就是：

    INSERT INTO `product_category` (name) SELECT `category`  from `competitor_sources`  group by category  order by count(category) desc



有個 freq count  的主意也不錯，所以我在 `category` model 裡加入 conunt： 

    count = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)


然後按 freq 從高到低放到去 id 的做法就變成是：

    INSERT INTO `product_category` (name, count) SELECT `category`, count(category)  from `competitor_sources`  group by category  order by count(category) desc
